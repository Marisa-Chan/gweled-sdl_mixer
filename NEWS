0.7:
----

- Fixes for gcc4 (Adrian Reber)
-

0.6:
----

- almost fixed the hiscore files install bug (it's hardcoded to /var/games now, if your Gnome install is different, then move the 2 files where appropriate). I'll gladly accept patches to the install scripts to fix that definitely, thanks :-)
- fixed the hiscore table display when there are less than 10 entries recorded
- display the timed hiscore table when in hiscore mode. This is a bit confusing since it's not visible anywhere that you are in timed mode... maybe next time :-)
- fixed a crash in the drag'n'drop code
- highlight the drop target when dragging
- updated the spec file. hope it works as I don't have a RedHat system anymore (Go Ubuntu !)
